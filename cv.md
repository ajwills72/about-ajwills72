## Research

**Summary**: I work on the psychology and neuroscience of category learning – how we learn to divide the world into groups of things. I use computer-based testing of adult humans, formal computational modelling, and various neuorscience methdologies (including fMRI and EEG). I also work on the role of errors in learning and memory more generally. Over a 23-year history of academic publishing, I have produced around 90 publications,  which have been cited around 1600 times. I have an h-index of 23. 

**Detail**: My most influential work has been in the following five areas:

1. **Relationship between visual attention and errors in learning**. From early behavioural and neuroscience work published in 2003-2007,  and continuing to the present day, I’ve substantially increased our understanding of how the re-allocation of visual attention not only normally leads to fast, efficient learning, but can also lead to systemtically irrational behaviour under certain conditions. Indicative publications: [1](http://www.willslab.org.uk/pubs/lepelley2016_postprint.pdf), [2](http://www.willslab.org.uk/pubs/2007Willsetal.pdf), [5](http://www.willslab.org.uk/pubs/2005lepelley.pdf), [11](http://www.willslab.org.uk/pubs/2003lochmannwills.pdf)

2. **Practice and process of computational modelling in psychology**. Since a seminal theory paper in 2012, I’ve worked consistently to improve the quality and impact of computational modelling in psychology. Indicative publications: [3](http://www.willslab.org.uk/pubs/2012willspothos.pdf), [4](http://www.willslab.org.uk/pubs/2011pothos.pdf).

3. **Development of Combination Theory of object classification** (#5, 6, 9, 16, 19, 21). If you’ve ever come across the terms 'holistic' or 'analytic' in the context of thinking, this work is relevant to the use of those terms. In brief, their use is largely inappropriate in object classification, which involves synthesis of object representations over time, not analysis of initially holistic forms. Starting in 2004, producing a seminal work in Cognitive Psychology in 2015,  and continuing to the present day, my work in this area has led to a fundamental reconceptualization of several classic results in the field. 

4. **Dual-process accounts of category learning** (#11, 13, 14, 22, 23). Dual-process thoeries are the modern embodiment of the Freudian view that we have both conscious, rational thought processes, and unconcscious, less-rational ones – see also "Thinking Fast and Slow" by Nobel-prize-winning author Daniel Kahneman. Starting in 2011, and continuing to the present day, I’ve thoroughly critiqued the most famous dual-process account of category learning (COVIS), and developed better experiments and analysis techniques to address the same questions more adequately.

5. **Categorical decision mechanisms** (#18, 20). Early-career work, done during my Ph.D. and Junior Research Fellowship. I built a new formal model of categorical decision making, and showed empirically that it was superior to the ones currently in use. 

I also really enjoy helping others with their research passions. This has often turned out rather well, with some well-cited work on (a) the differences between avian and human visual cognition (#8, 17, 24), (b) perceptual learning (#10),  and (c) depressive rumination (#12).
