## Research

**Summary**: I work on the psychology and neuroscience of category learning – how we learn to divide the world into groups of things. I use computer-based testing of adult humans, formal computational modelling, and various neuroscience methodologies (including fMRI and EEG). I also work on the role of errors in learning and memory more generally. Over a 23-year history of academic publishing, I have produced around 90 publications,  which have been cited around 1600 times. I have an h-index of 23. 

**Detail**: My most influential work has been in the following five areas:

1. **Attention and learning**. The re-allocation of visual attention in response to errors usually supports fast, efficient learning, but can also lead to systemtically irrational behaviour under certain conditions. Key publications in [2016](http://www.willslab.org.uk/pubs/lepelley2016_postprint.pdf), [2007](http://www.willslab.org.uk/pubs/2007Willsetal.pdf), [2003](http://www.willslab.org.uk/pubs/2003lochmannwills.pdf).

2. **Computational modelling**. Improving the quality and impact of computational modelling in psychology. Indicative publications: [3](http://www.willslab.org.uk/pubs/2012willspothos.pdf), [4](http://www.willslab.org.uk/pubs/2011pothos.pdf).

3. **Combination Theory of object classification**. Object classification involves synthesis of object representations over time, not analysis of initially holistic forms. Starting in 2004, my work in this area has led to a fundamental reconceptualization of several classic results in the field. Indicative publications: (#5, 6, 9, 16, 19, 21)

4. **Dual-process accounts of category learning** (#11, 13, 14, 22, 23). Dual-process thoeries are the modern embodiment of the Freudian view that we have both conscious, rational thought processes, and unconcscious, less-rational ones – see also "Thinking Fast and Slow" by Nobel-prize-winning author Daniel Kahneman. Starting in 2011, and continuing to the present day, I’ve thoroughly critiqued the most famous dual-process account of category learning (COVIS), and developed better experiments and analysis techniques to address the same questions more adequately.

5. **Categorical decision mechanisms** (#18, 20). Early-career work, done during my Ph.D. and Junior Research Fellowship. I built a new formal model of categorical decision making, and showed empirically that it was superior to the ones currently in use. 

I also really enjoy helping others with their research passions. This has often turned out rather well, with some well-cited work on (a) the differences between avian and human visual cognition (#8, 17, 24), (b) perceptual learning (#10),  and (c) depressive rumination (#12).
