## On intelligence

"...I prefer to refer to it as 'successful intelligence.' And the reason is that the
emphasis is on the use of your intelligence to achieve success in your life. So
I define it as your skill in achieving whatever it is you want to attain in your
life within your sociocultural context â€” meaning that people have different
goals for themselves, and for some it's to get very good grades in school and to
do well on tests, and for others it might be to become a very good basketball
player or actress or musician." (R.J. Sternberg, 2003).
