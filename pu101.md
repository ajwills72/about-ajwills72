# Generalization in human category learning: A connectionist explanation of differences in gradient after discriminative and non-discriminative training

## Summary

_One of the first papers to consider the possibility that the 'ratio rule' (Luce choice axiom) was not the best approach to formally modelling decisions in category learning; also contains an empirical demonstration that generalization gradients sharpen under discriminative training_.

## Abstract

Two experiments are reported that investigate the difference in gradient of
generalization observed between one-category (non-discriminative) and
two-category (discriminative) training. Extrapolating from the results of a
number of animal learning studies, it was predicted that the gradient should be
steeper under discriminative training. The first experiment confirms this basic
prediction for the stimuli used , which were novel, prototype-structured, and
constructed from 12 symbols positioned on a grid. An explanation for the
effect, based on the Rescorla-Wagner theory of Pavlovian conditioning (Rescorla
& Wagner, 1972), is that under non- discriminative training "in cidental stimu
li" have significant contr l over responding, whereas u nder discriminative
training they do not. Incidental stimuli are those aspects of the stimulus, or
the surrounding context, that are not differentially reinforced under
discriminative training. This explanation leads to the prediction that a comp
arable effect of blocked versus intermixed discriminative training should also
be found . This prediction is disconfirmed by the second experiment. An
alternative model, still based on the Rescorla-Wagner theory but with the
addition of a decision mechanism comprising a threshold unit and a competitive
network system , is proposed , and its ability to predict both the choice
probabilities and the pattern of response times found is evaluated via
simulation.
