# Gifts

If you're thinking of buying me a gift then, first, thank you - that's really nice. And second, sorry, 
I'm not necessarily the easiest person to buy for. This is mainly because I can easily feel overwhelmed
by 'stuff' and would in general like less stuff in my life, rather than more. But...

I do collect things. Here are some of the things I collect, and what I already have. Many of these things you can find on eBay, or via Discogs

- Modern, variant edition Star Wars comics

- Classic Star Wars comics

- Vinyl records of electronic music that is not available on CD and not available as FLAC.
