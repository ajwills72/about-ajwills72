# Gifts

If you're thinking of buying me a gift then, first, thank you - that's really
nice. And second, sorry, I'm not necessarily the easiest person to buy for. This is mainly because I can easily feel overwhelmed by "stuff" and would in general like less stuff in my life, rather than more. But, I do support some charities, and I also collect various small, old, rare things. Either of these categories are always good gift options. Some details below.

## Charitable donations

I'd be happy for your gift to be a donation to one of the people or organizations I suport. If you prefer to give physical stuff, then many of these offer T-shirts (I'm a Large) and stickers as part of their donation packages. For example:

### Digital freedom and privacy

[Free Software Foundation Europe](https://fsfe.org/) - Increasing public understanding of how Free Software contributes to freedom, transparency, and self-determination.
