# Gifts

If you're thinking of buying me a gift then, first, thank you - that's really nice. And second, sorry, 
I'm not necessarily the easiest person to buy for. This is mainly because I can easily feel overwhelmed
by 'stuff' and would in general like less stuff in my life, rather than more. But...

I do like collections of old, small, things. In particular, old Star Wars comics, which are easily found on eBa
