# Gifts

If you're thinking of buying me a gift then, first, thank you - that's really nice. And second, sorry, 
I'm not necessarily the easiest person to buy for. This is mainly because I can easily feel overwhelmed
by 'stuff' and would in general like less stuff in my life, rather than more. But...

## Charitable donations

I'd be happy for your gift to be a donation to one of the people or organizations I suport. For example:
