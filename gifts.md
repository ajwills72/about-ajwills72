# Gifts

If you're thinking of buying me a gift then, first, thank you - that's really nice. And second, sorry, 
I'm not necessarily the easiest person to buy for. This is mainly because I can easily feel overwhelmed
by 'stuff' and would in general like less stuff in my life, rather than more. But...

## I collect small old things

Here are some of the things I collect, and what I already have within those collections. Many of these things you can find on [eBay](https://www.ebay.co.uk), [Discogs](https://www.discogs.com), or [BookFinder](https://www.bookfinder.com/)

- Modern, variant edition Star Wars comics

- [Classic Star Wars comics](classic-star-wars.html)

- Old or rare physical recordings (vinyl, cassette, CD) of electronic music

- Old or rare books in the areas of: science fiction, computing, space, psychology.

## I like tasty (but perhaps not that healthy) food and drink

For example:

- Craft ale

- Single-malt Scotch whiskey

- Mouldy cheese (Stilton, etc)

- Crystallized fruit and ginger


## I donate to various artists, journalists, and chartities

I'd be happy for your gift to be a donation to one of the things I suport. For example:
