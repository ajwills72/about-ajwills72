# Gifts

If you're thinking of buying me a gift then, first, thank you - that's really
nice. And second, sorry, I'm not necessarily the easiest person to buy for. This is mainly because I can easily feel overwhelmed by "stuff" and would in general like less stuff in my life, rather than more. 

In 2020/21, I've decided to make an exception for interesting print books, and vinyl records. Below are some suggestions of things I would like but do not have:

## Print books

- David Graeber (2018). _Bullshit jobs_.

- Don Miguel Ruiz (2008). _The four agreements_.

- Marcus Aurelius. _Meditations_ (apparently there are some poor translations, so check out reviews) 

## Vinyl records

- Helena Hauff. [Qualm](https://helenahauff.bandcamp.com/album/qualm).

- The Normal. _Warm Leatherette / T.V.O.D_

- Ray Lynch. _Deep Breakfast_.

## Other iddeas

If neither of those lists spark joy in you, here's some other ideas:

### Charitable donations

I'd be happy for your gift to be a donation to one of the people or organizations I suport. If you prefer to give physical stuff, then many of these offer T-shirts (I'm a Large) and stickers as part of their donation packages. For example:

[Electronic Frontier Foundation](https://www.eff.org/) -  Defending digital privacy, free speech, and innovation. 

[Free Software Foundation Europe](https://fsfe.org/) - Increasing public understanding of how Free Software contributes to freedom, transparency, and self-determination.

[Tor Project](https://www.torproject.org/) - Supporting privacy and anonymity online.

[ZoÃ« Blade](https://www.patreon.com/zoeblademusic/posts) - Instrumental electronic music.

[Late Night Linux](https://www.patreon.com/LateNightLinux/posts) - Linux podcast

### Collecting things

Here are some of the things I collect, and what I already have within those collections. Many of these things you can find on [eBay](https://www.ebay.co.uk), [Discogs](https://www.discogs.com), or [BookFinder](https://www.bookfinder.com/). Clicking on the links below takes you to a page that lists the current contents on my collections.
