# Gifts

If you're thinking of buying me a gift then, first, thank you - that's really
nice. And second, sorry, I'm not necessarily the easiest person to buy for. This is mainly because I can easily feel overwhelmed by "stuff" and would in general like less stuff in my life, rather than more. 

In 2020/21, I've decided to make an exception for interesting print books, and vinyl records. Below are some suggestions of things I would like but do not have:

## Print books

- Guy Standing (2017). _Basic Income: And How We Can Make It Happen_.

- Christina Brown (2009). _The Yoga Bible_.

## Vinyl records

- Ray Lynch. _Deep Breakfast_.

## Ceremonial Cacao

Cacao, consumed as a drink. 

- [Cacao block](https://www.forevercacao.co.uk/products/100-ceremonial-grade-cacao)

- [Block and cups etc. on Etsy](https://www.etsy.com/uk/search?q=cacao%20ceremony&ref=auto-1)


## Other ideas

If neither of those lists spark joy in you, here's some other ideas:

### Charitable donations

I'd be happy for your gift to be a donation to one of the people or organizations I suport. If you prefer to give physical stuff, then many of these offer T-shirts (I'm a Large) and stickers as part of their donation packages. For example:

[Electronic Frontier Foundation](https://www.eff.org/) -  Defending digital privacy, free speech, and innovation. 

[Free Software Foundation Europe](https://fsfe.org/) - Increasing public understanding of how Free Software contributes to freedom, transparency, and self-determination.

[Tor Project](https://www.torproject.org/) - Supporting privacy and anonymity online.

[ZoÃ« Blade](https://www.patreon.com/zoeblademusic/posts) - Instrumental electronic music.

[Late Night Linux](https://www.patreon.com/LateNightLinux/posts) - Linux podcast

### Collecting things

Here are some of the things I collect, and what I already have within those collections. Many of these things you can find on [eBay](https://www.ebay.co.uk), [Discogs](https://www.discogs.com), or [BookFinder](https://www.bookfinder.com/). Clicking on the links below takes you to a page that lists the current contents on my collections.
